        <p>Even the world's largest development efforts are still implemented by individuals at the local level. Data can both enable these people to do their jobs and be used to hold them accountable when they fail. Collecting data and making it open is the key to avoid "black box" systems that fail to deliver because of inefficiency and corruption. Right?</p>

      <p>Well, the story is not quite that simple. Open data may be the key, but it is not the end of the story. India's rural employment guarantee, the world's largest workfare program, did everything right: a worthy and well-reasoned effort to improve those in extreme poverty. It collected its data and opened it to the public online. Yet in 2013 [when X rural official above was trying to do Y] that goldmine of data was buried in a website that was virtually unusable.</p>

  <p>Now government officials and researchers at <a href="http://epod.cid.harvard.edu/">Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD)</a> are working to make that open data usable. The story of their effort is a case study on the <em>small steps</em> that lead to development on the <em>large scale</em>. It exemplifies the promise of smart, new methods of collaboration to spur interlinked improvements in transparency and public service delivery.</p>

  <h2 id="nrega">MGNREGA</h2>
  <h3>The 5.47 billion dollar promise</h3>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.nrega.nic.in/netnrega/home.aspx">Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act</a>, or MGNREGA, is a big name for a very big program. It is a little like the Works Progress Administration (which sought to relieve those impoverished by the Great Depression in the US by employing them in infrastructure improvement) but on a far larger scale. MGNREGA guarantees India's rural poor 100 days' annual employment, and so benefits up to 50 million households annually at a cost of nearly <a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-02-28/news/59613143_1_mgnrega-budgetary-allocation-prime-minister-narendra-modi">5.47 billion dollars</a> (347 billion rupees) in 2015 alone.</p>
  <p>It was passed in 2005 after <span class="todo">[a bit of the process and reasoning]</span>. Unlike the WPA, MGNREGA is meant to be a permanent addition to India's policy landscape. It intends to <span class="todo">[raise wages, improve living standards, X, and Y – with the added benefit of improving roads, creating irrigation canals, and X]</span>.</p>

  <h3>Evaluating the promise</h3>
  <p>But the program is under constant attack by leaders in government who would rather spend that money elsewhere, and leaders in business who would rather to keep wages low. Complaints include <span class="todo">[X, and that the projects are just busy work with no value – cite these]</span>.</p>
  <p>Such arguments are debatable, but what is without question is that MGNREGA has been plagued by leakages and delays in wage payment – perhaps unsurprisingly given the program's size and the fact that thus far wages have been paid in cash via local agents.</p>
  <p>Despite criticisms, observational <a href="http://www.ideasforindia.in/article.aspx?article_id=292" target="_blank">studies</a> suggest that MGNREGA does benefit the poor. The program increases wages and consumption, improves skillsets, and decreases child labor and distress migration (moving away from drought or poverty rather than toward some advantage). Other <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-digging-holes-myth-2/">studies</a> have shown that, contrary to criticisms, MGNREGA projects are generally useful, well-executed and good for the economy. <span class="todo">[Maybe expand this a little rather than just he hyperlinks.]</span></p>
  <p>So how can these criticisms be addressed? In other contexts in rich and poor countries, transparency has proved an effective means to improve programs and prove their worth.</p>
  <p><span class="pop">From its inception in 2005, MGNREGA has shown a commitment to transparency.</span> When <a href="http://epod.cid.harvard.edu/">we</a> began our collaboration in 2013, MGNREGA already had one of the largest databases for a social program in the developing world – ostensibly for the use of administrators, policymakers, and the public.</p>
  <p>If MGNREGA fails target funds and track progress, it could well succumb to critics.</p>

  <h3>Fighting for survival</h3>
  <p>The program's commitment to transparency has opened it both to research that shows its benefits and to scrutiny from opponents. Moreover, the program's open nature meant that its data has gone into vast datasets, creating one of the largest databases for a social program in the developing world – ostensibly for the use of administrators, policymakers, and the public. </p>
  <p>Our ultimate goal is to see this administrative data guide program improvements, so MGNREGA can provide an increasingly effective, and cost efficient, safety net for the millions of rural Indians living in extreme poverty.</p>

  <h3>Roots of EPoD/MGNREGA collaboration</h3>

  <h3>Wider challenges facing policy actors within MoRD at higher levels</h3>
  <p>MGNREGA is a highly decentralized program, run by local officials across the country, who upload data to a centralized management information system, or MIS. The website providing access to that data sprawled over thousands of pages and offered little guidance to the user. Assembling useful datasets required dozens, if not hundreds, of clicks and an extensive working knowledge of the site. As is common across many Indian government data portals, the data tables available on the site had a deeply nested structure that made it difficult to construct datasets across multiple regions– the kind needed for even the most basic analyses – without resorting to time and skill-intensive data scraping. </p>
  <p>EPoD's initial work with the <a href="http://rural.nic.in/netrural/rural/index.aspx">Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD)</a> made clear that complex institutional coordination was a prerequisite to improving its data's utility.</p>
  <p>As we worked alongside technicians at India's National Informatics Centre (NIC), we came to recognize how organizational factors had caused one of the biggest development datasets to be, to that point, effectively buried. There was a paucity of technical staff in the ministry, which, combined with an inefficient site architecture, led to a slow, overtaxed system.</p>

  <h3>Setting the data free</h3>
  <p>The <a href="mnregaweb4.nic.in/netnrega/dynamic2/dynamicreport_new4.aspx">MGNREGA Public Data Portal</a> was launched in March 2014, followed by a companion set of interactive data visualizations (<a href="http://164.100.129.6/Netnrega/nrega-reportdashboard/index.html#/">Report Dashboards</a>) in August of the same year. In July 2015 we launched <a href="http://164.100.129.6/Netnrega/nrega-reportdashboard/index.html#/villageview">Village view</a>, a village-level lens on MGNREGA activities. After a long journey, we launched one of the finishing touches to the project, the Reports Dashboard. We had a few MoRD officials in a room and, via videoconference, state-level administrators from each of about twenty states. We gave a walkthrough of how to create reports, and received polite applause. Given this modest christening (and the fact that bureaucrats are often set in their ways) we wondered if the Data Portal would see much use. </p>

    </div>
  <p>Since the launch of each product, the Ministry has maintained and updated the platforms, making them more robust and versatile. As we write, one aspect of the Portal alone, the Reports Dashboard, is approaching 150,000 views by over 100,000 users in one year.</p>

  <h3>Lessons</h3>
  <p>Introductory para about the lessons we learned.</p>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Mollitia possimus vitae, tenetur quis maxime sequi sed vel, nesciunt explicabo, officiis nobis veniam quos. Ratione dicta animi qui vero dolorem. Optio?</p>

  <h4>1. Invest in staff</h4>
  <p>First, invest in staff.</p>
  <p>In our collaboration with MoRD, we saw there had long been an underinvestment in technical staff. Ironically, this may have been a byproduct of otherwise-beneficial safeguards against cronyism, which makes expensive new hires subject to substantial scrutiny. <span class="pop">However in this case, an overstretched, underqualified staff combined with antiquated technology and strained servers to effectively bury one of the world's biggest development datasets. With tech staff, you get what you pay for.</span>Consensus about the necessary costs and the qualifications technicians should help the government hire the right technicians without risking corruption.</p>

  <h4>2. Use "agile" methods</h4>
  <p>One immediate implication was that the tech team and the "client" – in this case, the bureaucrats in the ministry – both struggled to manage each other effectively. The bureaucrats struggled to shape their requests to the tech team and effectively communicate their needs, while the developers struggled under a heavy workload and inadequate managerial cover against new requests and feature creep (loading a platform with add-ons that diverted it from its original function).</p>
  <p>Judicious use of early prototypes and a clearly defined set of user needs outlined jointly with ministry officials helped mitigate the worst of these issues in our development of the Public Data Portal. Of particular use were principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile software development</a>, which stress early and frequent feedback from the client. These principles have become widely used in software development; the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service">United States Digital Service (USDS)</a> promotes them in government IT projects. By quickly producing prototypes and proceeding through cycles of cooperative iteration, we circumvented long gaps in approval time and matched the needs of the ministry to the abilities of the development team. We also worked to build buy-in from NIC programmers by writing code alongside them on a daily basis, providing training on technical best practices to their team, and highlighting the role of key programmers in the presence of senior ministry officials.</p>

  <h4>3. Identify problem collaboratively at the get-go: <span class="todo">NESTA WORDING</span></h4>
  <p>Third, design the project as a collaboration between policymakers, researchers and technicians.</p>
  <p>Across the world, government ministries hand projects over to researchers then return later for a finished product. The resulting policies – tech-based and otherwise – often work very differently after the researchers go home. <span class="pop">Our Harvard-based team has created a method we call <em>Smart Policy Design</em>, where researchers don't just give answers, they sit down with policymakers to help formulate the question.</span> Together with the MoRD officials, we determined the best indicators to track and how to present the data. Then we worked side-by-side with technicians at India's National Informatics Centre to build the Portal. (That's literally side-by-side: we often worked two to a computer, as there were none to spare.) Since completion, the Ministry has not maintained the Portal, they've updated it, making it more robust and versatile.</p>

  <h3><span id="future">The future</span></h3>
  <p>Next steps in our collaboration include investigating how officials are using the data and experimenting with how to optimize Portal use. But in the meantime, our experience has given us some insight into how ride the wave of public enthusiasm for transparency in government programs.</p>
  <p>A/B testing is the standard way Silicon Valley improves its online products, employing users as unwitting guinea pigs. If an online sales team is wondering which version of an offer will get the most clicks, their website will randomize which one users see, and often automatically scale up the winner. Decisions that used to be made in long meetings of marketing teams, or by CEOs, are now made, unknowingly, by users and their clicks. To learn whether these potential efficiency gains can be carried over into policy research, we are deploying A/B testing in a setting quite distinct from Silicon Valley: the Indian state of Bihar, one of India's poorest areas. </p>
  <p>Our basic question is whether visualized, easy-to-understand presentations of data can increase data usage by officials relative to plain-text versions of the same information – even in a place like Bihar. We are sending visualized report cards of MGNREGA performance data to officials in Bihar on a randomized basis, showing performance in a variety of ways.  Further, we have begun running regular A/B tests on email campaigns used to send messages to MGNREGA officials to look at operational questions, such as what days and times notifications should be sent to officials to increase the likelihood they will be viewed. </p>
  <p>Operational questions are just the beginning. We are also testing behavioral hypotheses about users: Are policymakers and implementers more inclined to act on negative information (<i>There are major payment delays in your district</i>), positive information (<i>See how you've progressed toward your goal of cutting delays</i>), or through peer comparisons (<i>Look at how the neighboring districts are doing</i>)? Since A/B testing only tells you what works, not how, we will complement these tests with additional data sources. Overall, the aim is to use the lessons learned from our A/B testing to address program implementation challenges where information gaps may be partially to blame. </p>

  
  <h2 id="bigpic">BIG PICTURE</h2>
  <p>So how does this experience in India relate to bigger issues, such as big data and transparency? In recent years we've witnessed a push for governments to assemble their administrative data into big datasets and open them to the public, with several goals in mind: make governments more transparent and accountable, track progress toward performance targets, and help policymakers and administrators do their jobs effectively. But this requires technical and organizational know-how as well as political shifts. So, often open data initiatives stumble in their implementation, leaving the promise unfulfilled.</p>

  <h3>Big data</h3>
  <p>Governments are opening their data. Now comes the hard part.</p>
  <p>There is an important distinction between <em>active</em> and <em>passive</em> transparency. Right to Information (RTI) acts might encuorage the latter, by design; this then disincentivizes the former. In a recent training session conducted under the aegis of our <a href="http://epod.cid.harvard.edu/bcure" target="_blank">Building Capacity to Use Research Evidence</a> program (funded by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development" target="_blank">UK Department for International Development</a>), we asked Indian administrators what held them back from making public data that has already been collected. Their response was that if researchers wanted to see the data, they could file a request under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
  <p>Over the last half-century, Freedom of Information Acts have spread from Northern Europe to over <a href="http://www.right2info.org/access-to-information-laws/access-to-information-laws" target="_blank">95 countries</a>, rich and poor. That spread has granted citizens, researchers and the press access to a wide range of government records. <span class="pop">We often hear bureaucrats in India and beyond make the argument that, given that access – as well as the abundance of household surveys and open data initiatives – they have little reason to invest limited government resources in collecting, collating and publishing data.</span> Moreover, if you add the possibility that policymakers can suffer adverse consequences when researchers analyze their programs, then the impetus to resist reform becomes strong.</p>
  <p>Undeniably, if governments heed the growing call for a "<a href="http://www.undatarevolution.org/report/" target="_blank">data revolution</a>," researchers will reap great benefits. So will high-level decision makers tracking big development goals and, importantly, in-country administrators trying to evaluate their public sector programs. But even as governments comply and the data becomes available, a number of recent articles have exposed the gaps between big datasets and their usability, reliability and utility. See <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/04/28/using-opinion-surveys-to-monitor-the-u-n-s-sustainable-development-goals/" target="_blank">Pippa Norris</a> on the need to "triangulate" big data with more focused measures to track development; <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jun/22/why-we-shouldnt-get-too-excited-about-using-big-data-for-development">Paul Jasper</a> on the security risks involved, and remembering the still-huge undigitized population; <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jul/13/big-small-data-global-development" target="_blank">Daniella Ballou-Aares and Tony Pipa</a> on the financial investment required; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/20/data-poverty-makes-it-harder-to-fix-real-poverty-thats-why-the-un-should-push-countries-to-gather-and-share-data/" target="_blank">Rohini Pande and Florian Blum</a> on the political economy considerations involved; and <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/big-data-actually-reinforcing-social-inequalities/" target="_blank">Michelle Chen</a> on ways that big data can reinforce social inequalities – to name just a few.</p>

  <h3>High-velocity data</h3>
  <p>In the <a href="http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Resources/Static/Products/Progress2015/English2015.pdf" target="_blank">final report</a> on the UN's Millennium Development Goals released on 6 July, the UN put the need for quality, open data high on the post-2015 agenda. "Real-time data are needed to deliver better decisions faster," the report said, before going on to point out "most development data have a time lag of two to three years." </p>
  <p>This is true: it may be years before we disseminate our findings through a peer-reviewed paper. But this time can be spent observing, evaluating, and even tweaking the aspects of policy design and implementation that surface. This is what <a href="http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/81070/1/732552060.pdf" target="_blank">Lant Pritchett and coauthors</a> have called "crawling the design space" – taking the "best practices" principle from business and applying it to public programs by continually collecting data and actively scanning project design for possible improvements. New methods such as A/B testing are ideal for crawling the design space, as they provide real-time, actionable data.</p>
  <p>It is essential to preserve the academic rigor of peer-reviewed publishing, but depending on traditional publishing alone results in the lag time cited by the UN. Blogs and social media can be used to disseminate findings in the research process – even as those findings determine the next step in the project. Furthermore, collaborations between researchers and policymakers can reap benefits beyond research papers – resulting in open data that is useful to officials, academics, and the public alike. In these ways, we are hopeful that the process, which we call <em>Smart Policy Design</em>, can create better, more purpose-driven policy, and accelerate knowledge creation for the next stage of development.</p>

  <h3><span class="todo">Three layers of support, and relate that back to the India case, maybe again quoting Mr Reddy.</span></h3>
  <p>A <a href="http://www.transparency-initiative.org/reports/open-data-study-new-technologies" target="_blank">2010 report</a> by the Transparency and Accountability Initiative argued that in countries where data was open and useable for change, three tiers of society had been engaged:
  <blockquote>An influential and active civil society provided the 'bottom up' pressure for change through traditional advocacy and by setting up innovative websites demonstrating how open information could be used. Civil servants and state and federal administrators who saw open data as a way of improving efficiency provided the 'middle layer'. Finally, high-level political leaders including Heads of States and Ministers provided the third layer.</blockquote></p>
  <p>The millions of RTI requests that have been filed in the last decade serve as strong evidence of "bottom up" pressure for transparency in Indian society. And in EPoD's training activities and other collaborations with government ministries, we have seen among the "middle layer" a broad recognition of the value of open data, or at least a willingness to learn. </p>
  <p>It remains up to that top layer to invest in data infrastructure needed for government to be actively transparent. This is not cheap. But like physical infrastructure – roads, power grids, water systems – improvements may pay for themselves through efficiency gains in the long run, and will confer benefits on the population in the meantime.</p>
  <p>Achieving transparency is more than a matter of casting back a curtain and revealing the truth. Even in a near best-case scenario like ours – a supportive ministry and terabytes of data, all of it open – didn't make for transparent, useful data. It took a technically and politically complex process.</p>

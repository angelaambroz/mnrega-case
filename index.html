        <p id="top">The world’s largest and most ambitious development programs are implemented by individuals at the local level. Data can both enable these people to do their jobs and serve as a tool to help monitor them and hold them accountable – but only if the information is in a useable form. For a programme to be open in practice as well as in theory, its data must flow in and out smoothly, with narratives that support its use by all stakeholders.</p>

        </blockquote>

        <p>Take the case of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in 2013. That year, India’s flagship rural development effort and the world’s largest workfare programme benefitted as many as 50 million households at a cost of nearly 5 billion dollars (330 billion rupees).</p>

        <p>For its impoverished beneficiaries, the interface to this massive programme was often a one-room village, or <em>panchayat</em>, office, not much bigger than a garden shed. There, the day-to-day administrative duties were up to the <em>gram rogar sayak</em> (GRS), working for 3800 rupees a month – about 50 dollars – in a contracted position with no opportunity for advancement up through the ranks of the civil service.</p>

        <p>Reddy Subrahmanyam, then-Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) which administers MGNREGA, describes what that meant for the GRS working in a typical <em>panchayat</em> office where "broadband was only a namesake." He says that during the daytime, bandwidth was taken up with other office activities. "What our field personnel used to do was work through the night, because they had to enter the data. During the daytime they would sleep in the office. Then after midnight they’d get their bandwidth, do their work, then leave at 3AM every day."</p>

    <p>One GRS who we met in the Morena District of Madhya Pradesh, Harendra Gurjar, told us he had no connectivity at all. He worked from home, he explained, showing us around the nearly completed structure that would become his office (itself a MGNREGA works project). In the meantime, he kept paper records during the week, then on weekends travelled to the nearest city, Gwalior, and did his data entry at an internet cafe.</p>

    <p>The result of the huge data collection effort was one of the largest development databases in the world: terabytes of data with more than 200,000 data points flowing in every day – all ostensibly accessible by the public via a website.</p>

    <p>However, due to the structure of the site, little information was flowing back out. It was all there if you knew where to look, but almost no one did.</p>

    <p>Now the Joint Secretary of Information Technology and Skills at MoRD, Dr. Santhosh Mathew was formerly the Principal Secretary of Rural Development in Bihar and thus oversaw MGNREGA in one of India’s poorest states. He describes the problem: "We still hadn’t surmounted the problem of addressing the needs of users of different kinds. There are users who are workers; there are users who are <em>panchayat</em>-level administrators; the users who are block, district, state, national administrators; there are academicians who need the data to come up with meaningful hypotheses and test them. And there are activists who want to make sure that the rights that have been given to them through this statute are actually available. All these are different constituencies, their information needs are separate, and we had nothing which would cater to this."</p>

    <p>In 2013, Mathew, Subrahmanyam, and others at MoRD began a collaboration with researchers at <a href="http://epod.cid.harvard.edu/">Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD)</a> based at Harvard Kennedy School on what would become the <a href="http://mnregaweb4.nic.in/netnrega/GeneralError.htm?flag=1" target="_blank">MGNREGA Public Data Portal</a>. In 2014, the project expanded under the auspices of the <a href="https://bcureglobal.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Building Capacity to Use Research Evidence (BCURE)</a> program, funded by the UK’s Department for International Development.</p>

    <p>In a pilot project aiming to strengthen information systems for use by administrators, the team added <a href="http://164.100.129.6/Netnrega/nrega-reportdashboard/index.html#/" target="_blank">dashboards for programme administrators</a> and a <a href="http://164.100.129.6/Netnrega/nrega-reportdashboard/index.html#/villageview" target="_blank">micro-data access system</a>, trained developers at India’s National Informatics Centre, and began devising interventions to measure and optimize administrators’ use of MGNREGA data.</p>

    <p>The work continues today, under separate funding. But the story of the collaboration that started in 2013 is a case study on the small steps that lead to development on the large scale. It provides valuable lessons for how to conduct policy-research engagements and build government capacity to practice active rather than passive transparency.</p>

    <h2 id="protecting">A programme worth protecting</h2>

    <p>MGNREGA became law in 2005 and was implemented starting in 2006, covering the entire nation in 2008. It functioned somewhat like the USA’s Works Progress Administration – which sought to relieve those impoverished by the Great Depression by employing them in infrastructure improvements – but with far greater reach, affecting the lives not of millions, but hundreds of millions. And while the Works Progress Administration was only a temporary measure, MGNREGA was intended to become part of India’s permanent policy landscape: a right to labour granted to citizens.</p>
    
    <p>In guaranteeing every rural household 100 days’ annual employment at a minimum wage within 15 days of application, MGNREGA was admirably simple and egalitarian in concept. Anyone could apply for work, but the intended beneficiaries were unskilled rural citizens living in extreme poverty, and for them it served as a lifeline. </p>
    
    <p>"MGNREGA plays a big role in social protection for individuals whose link to the formal economy is tenuous," says Rohini Pande, Co-Director of EPoD and the BCURE-Harvard Team Lead on the project. "You need a system that is flexible, available in their village, and something that ideally they can turn to quite fast in times of need. The fact the MGNREGA project is in your village, available near home, is particularly important for women who face mobility restrictions in much of India." </p>
    
    <p>The programme showed a commitment to transparency, right down to a sign posted at every worksite displaying its budget and the going wage. A <a href="http://nrega.nic.in/netnrega/writereaddata/Circulars/MGNREGA_SAMEEKSHA.pdf" target="_blank">2012 report</a> from MoRD said that MGNREGA was "perhaps the largest and most ambitious social security and public works programme in the world." </p>
  </section>
    
  <section class="col-lg-8">
    <p>But MGNREGA was also a locus of dispute on questions big and small, from whether it should exist at all, to whether some of its budget should be diverted toward skilling or unconditional cash transfers, down to the program’s acronym and how to pronounce it. Many would have preferred the government spend the money elsewhere, and many landlords and leaders in business would have preferred to keep rural wages low. Their arguments tended to cite the uselessness of MGNREGA projects (see sidebar).</p>

    <p>Such attacks rarely presented supporting evidence, but other criticisms were well founded. MGNREGA was plagued by leakages and delays in payment – perhaps unsurprisingly, given the program’s size and the fact that, to that point in 2013, wages were largely paid in cash via local agents. Furthermore, a <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTHDOFFICE/Resources/5485726-1334870720628/8597105-1334870749247/India_Evaluation_Report.pdf">study released by the World Bank in 2012</a> used survey data to show that MGNREGA’s ability to actually supply labour to those who requested it varied widely by state. While demand for work was higher in the poorest states, as one would expect, on average poorer states were less able to supply it. In total in 2009–10, 45 percent of rural households wanted work on the scheme and, of those, only 56 percent got it.</p>
    
    <p>The same study found that the programme successfully targeted women: in a country with chronically low female labour force participation, 48 percent of MGNREGA work hours were supplied to women in 2009–10. But this too varied widely by state, from 7 percent in Jammu and Kashmir to 88 percent in Kerala. On average, poorer states provided relatively fewer MGNREGA hours to women. </p>

  <section class="col-lg-8">
    <p>Despite such problems, the evidence generally supported the Ministry’s claims that MGNREGA improved the lives of the rural poor. A major goal was to raise wages, and a <a href="http://www.csae.ox.ac.uk/workingpapers/pdfs/csae-wps-2013-03.pdf">2013 study</a> showed it did raise them by roughly 5.5 percent in districts where the programme was phased in earlier compared to where it arrived later. Observational studies reviewed in an <a href="http://www.ideasforindia.in/article.aspx?article_id=292">article by Dilip Mookherjee</a> of Boston University suggested that MGNREGA improved skillsets, decreased child labour and distress migration (moving away from drought or poverty rather than toward some advantage), and reduced poverty. And a <a href="http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/09/23/000442464_20140923101649/Rendered/PDF/E46440V20P152200Box385324B00PUBLIC0.pdf">World Bank report</a> on poverty alleviation in the state of Andhra Pradesh said, "MGNREGA is widely popular in the rural areas and it is a great boon for the poor, especially the landless poor during the offseason."</p>
    
    <p>Further studies contradicted claims of pointless hole-digging, suggesting that projects were actually useful, well executed and good for the economy. An <a href="http://www.igidr.ac.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=411:igidr-working-paper-mgnrega-works-and-their-impacts-a-rapid-assessment-in-maharashtra&catid=1:latest&Itemid=51">audit conducted by the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research</a> checking over 4,000 MGNREGA projects in the state of Maharashtra found that 87 percent existed and were functional, and that 90 percent of locals surveyed considered them either very or somewhat useful. <a href="http://nrega.nic.in/netnrega/writereaddata/Circulars/MGNREGA_Sameeksha_2_Eng.pdf">Other studies</a> found that wells dug under MGNREGA benefited the economy and other projects were effective at preventing soil erosion and increasing water availability.</p>
    
    <p>All strong evidence that MGNREGA was worth the expense. Jean Drèze, an economist who helped draft the legislation, said in an <a href="http://www.catchnews.com/india-news/stagnant-wages-payment-delays-and-eroding-political-support-jean-dreze-on-10-years-of-mgnrega-1454471238.html">interview</a>, "MGNREGA defies many vested interests and it is bound to remain a struggle. But it is a struggle worth sustaining."</p>

    <p>Since this was a demand-driven programme – meaning the rural poor had to ask for work in order for it to be effective – aspects that decreased that demand would distort its impact. If a poor villager decided not to request work from MGNREGA because she thought it would be a long wait before she got paid, it might look like she didn’t ask because she didn’t need it. If this happened often enough, policymakers would underestimate the need for the program.</p>
    
    <p>Given this aspect of MGNREGA and its problems with leakage and payment delays, the programme was still at risk of succumbing to its critics. Better monitoring was needed to protect the programme and further prove its worth.</p>

                <p>Reddy Subrahmanyam was one of the architects of the MGNREGA data collection system and a policy partner on the Public Data Portal. In an interview, he painted the controversy surrounding MGNREGA as an expression of enduring class conflicts.</p>

                <blockquote>"Indian rural areas are largely feudal in nature. That means if you have the land, then you have people who are attached to that land. They have nowhere else to go so they are virtually bonded to that particular land, and if you are the owner, to you. What MGNREGA has done is provide an alternative to the worker – either to work on that land or to go and work on the public works. So once that choice is provided, the stranglehold of the landowner over the labour has loosened. It’s the classic scenario of a class struggle. When one class is trying to liberate itself from the stranglehold of the other, it will always lead to a lot of criticism. Protecting MGNREGA was a Herculean task. The people who lost out because of MGNREGA are the big landlords, the big construction companies who had cheap labour coming from rural areas – so they are all up in arms against the program. There was a constant threat to the programme right from the beginning."</blockquote>

      <h2 id="open">Open, but not transparent</h2>

      <p>In other contexts in rich and poor countries, transparency had proved an effective means – not only to improve programs and prove their worth, but to provide administrators at different levels with a window onto their own program. But was MGNREGA’s commitment to openness having the desired effect, or was it just opening the programme to attack?</p>

      <p>Prof. Pande describes her team’s initial conversations with MoRD officials. "They were very open to recognizing the fact that, as any programme evolves, you will need to refine and tweak it. If you want to do current evaluations of MGNREGA and get information that you can feed back immediately to improve, how would you do that? In the context of that discussion it became clear that you first need the information to be available, before you can think of using it in a feedback loop."</p>
      
      <p>To understand this, let’s return to that <em>panchayat</em>-level administrator, the <em>gram rozgar sevak</em> working into the wee hours inputting data on MGNREGA implementation. These data points flowed into vast datasets. The website providing access to them sprawled over thousands of pages and offered little guidance to the user. As is common across many government data portals around the world, the data tables available on the site had a deeply nested structure that made it difficult to construct datasets across multiple regions – the kind needed for even the most basic analyses – without resorting to time and skill-intensive data scraping.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="col-lg-8">
      <p>"The site’s navigation was not informative or intuitive," says Eric Dodge, the Data Analytics Lead at EPoD, "so the only way you could use it was if you already knew where to go, or else by clicking around. That was really inefficient for their servers too, because only maybe 20 percent of the page loads were what people actually wanted." In turn, these overtaxed servers frequently caused delays in the site’s availability.</p>
     
      <p>So in 2013, if a district-level manager were to approach the site for information to check on how MGNREGA was working in a certain block or village, she would probably not find the information. And if a GRS sought information on his own performance, he would almost certainly come away empty-handed – particularly if he were not highly educated, as was often the case. Meanwhile the servers were overtaxed and slow. As Santhosh Mathew puts it, the site "was impossible to use for anybody who did not know the website, whose life’s only work was not to look at that data."</p>

      <p>The way to inform administrators from top to bottom would be to make the data accessible, searchable and comparable along relevant parameters – and, importantly, to present the information visually.</p>

                  <p>Making data access intuitive often comes down to a question of information design, as you can see below. A user of the previous site, having found the data section of the website through trial and error, needed to navigate a set of deeply nested tables that made it difficult to choose customized cuts of the data or assemble complete datasets to be used for further analysis.</p>

                  <p>The nested navigation structure also meant many extraneous pages being loaded up – adding strain to the already taxed servers. By employing a more flexible design with a clear list of available parameters, the Public Data Portal was able to improve accessibility for a broad array of users while also improving the overall efficiency of the site.</p>

    <h2 id="collab">The collaboration</h2>

    <p>The proving ground in what would eventually become a successful collaboration between the Ministry of Rural Development and EPoD was to create the <a href="http://mnregaweb4.nic.in/netnrega/dynamic2/dynamicreport_new4.aspx" target="_blank">MGNREGA Public Data Portal</a>, an interface designed to serve as a one-stop shop for over 50 indicators deemed crucial for evaluating MGNREGA.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="col-lg-8">
    <p>Eric Dodge began working alongside National Informatics Centre (NIC) technicians within MoRD, often two to a computer because of stretched resources. Their collaboration was tentative at first, characterized by exploration and trial and error. But the similarities of their positions – NIC technicians were embedded within various government ministries including MoRD, much like Dodge was as a researcher – began to inspire a sense of camaraderie. After three weeks navigating political obstacles and several late nights solving technical problems, the group was able to pass basic pieces of data back and forth between the front and back end of the application. They knew that the partnership and the portal could be successful.</p>

              <p>A common narrative in development attributes a gap between researchers and policymakers to misaligned incentives. However, that presumes that the only task at hand is to identify and test the policy solution. EPoD researchers knew from past policy-research engagements that before you arrive at the solution, you need to identify the problem. In their experience, tweaking the problem definition had led to very different – and potentially more positive – evaluation outcomes, and the delivered policy solutions were more likely to work at scale and match policymakers’ needs.</p>

              <p>So the first step of the Public Data Portal project was for EPoD researchers to sit down with Ministry officials and determine the scope and intent of the project. Some ministers asked for the website to be "redone." That would have taken a team of skilled developers a year or more. EPoD instead suggested creating a tool to sit atop the website, then worked with ministers to determine the best indicators to track and how to present the data. This follows EPoD’s "Smart Policy Design" methodology, the first step of which is collaborative problem identification.</p>

"Especially when we were starting I made sure I was in there every few days, putting a face to the project and also listening to hear what issues they were talking about in the office. They know so much more than we do about the program. They know what the challenges are. So spending as much time with them as possible was a very good thing as we tried to understand how to support them better."</p>

              <p>The tasks that MGNREGA implementers generally faced involved attentive processing, that is, reading and mentally collating numbers from reports and spreadsheets, and making decisions accordingly. A <a href="http://faculty.utpa.edu/fowler/vis-papers/perception-cognition/Healy_2011_AttentionVisualMemoryVizCG_tvcg.pdf" target="_blank">wide literature</a> in vision research shows that if you harness the brain’s preattentive processing power – its ability to recognize colours and shapes in the microseconds before the intellect engages – then the information takes hold faster and lasts longer.</p>

              <p>Put differently, a picture is worth a thousand words, and graphs are easier to read than spreadsheets.</p>

              <p>At the heart of the MGNREGA Public Data Portal project was the idea that visualized information would help lower-level administrators do their jobs. Charity Troyer Moore saw firsthand the effect of a visualized option for MGNREGA administrators in Bihar state responsible for overseeing a number of villages. "They pored over it. They took that information and they were eager to digest it, pull it apart, talk about why this or that number was higher or lower than others. You don’t get that with plain old spreadsheets and paper orders."</p>

              <p>The visual advantage works at all levels of engagement. Eric Dodge says that, at the outset, having prototypes to demonstrate to MoRD officials what was in the realm of possibility helped "sell" the project. "Bureaucrats had the sense that they could be doing more, but they didn’t know what to ask for. Having a visual prompt to get them talking about their data and thinking about individual use cases for it and how it could help with decision making – that was really useful."</p>

    <p>As the project progressed, the EPoD team came to recognize the factors that had caused one of the biggest development datasets to be effectively buried. Predictably, some related to capacity (overstrained servers, few computers), and were hence unavoidable. But others mirrored the website architecture: obstacles that could be overcome with some vision and organizational change. EPoD researchers came up with a list of takeaways that they later disseminated in <a href="http://www.alliance4usefulevidence.org/to-get-the-right-policy-ask-the-right-question/" target="_blank">blog posts</a> and <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rti-rti-act-mgnrega/" target="_blank">opinion pieces</a>.</p>

              <p>The tech team at the National Informatics Centre and the "client" – bureaucrats in the ministry – struggled to communicate and meet each other’s needs. Historically this had led to an inefficient, ad hoc back-and-forth with poor overall strategic vision, a profusion of requests, and feature creep (loading a platform with add-ons that divert it from its original function). Furthermore, the team building the software was ultimately answerable to their bosses in the Centre rather than the end users at the MoRD – a tangled chain of command that caused further complications.</p>

              <p>To address the technical side of this challenge, EPoD staff encouraged the use of "agile" methodology, popular among software developers to keep fast-moving projects from going astray and creating waste. Working from a clearly defined set of user needs, the team created prototypes and proceeded through short rounds of cooperative iteration. This method kept all sides informed and involved, and the project on track. The researchers’ presence also seemed to offer a galvanizing effect, whereby the more political blockages were able to be overcome within the crucible of the collaboration.</p>

              <p>The United States Digital Service, which consults US government agencies to improve outcomes on IT projects, uses this methodology. The informatics departments of India and other developing countries stand much to gain and little to lose by following suit.</p>

    <p>Throughout the process, the relationships between all the players had to be handled with care. Santhosh Mathew said of the collaboration, "It had to be midwifed, the relationship had to be nurtured, a lot of give, no take. A lot of time went into that."</p>

              <p>The Ministry of Rural Development had insufficient tech staff and equipment to create a useable portal without outside help. On the staff end, this was in part the effect of safeguards against cronyism, which were well intended and otherwise beneficial, but which put expensive new hires subject to great scrutiny. Another reason, says Santhosh Mathew, was a thriving private IT sector. As India’s firms started servicing the world, they drew designers and other IT staff away from government jobs. The result was overworked developers with a backlog of requests and no time to keep up with the latest technical advances. Governments of developing countries may be able to overcome this hurdle and hire the right staff without risking corruption if they come up with guidelines on the necessary costs and desired qualifications of technicians.</p>

              <p>As far as technical equipment, EPoD staff also realized they could improve digital services, especially website speed, by increasing the use of open-source technologies, which avoid costly licensing fees that can create procurement bottlenecks, and by taking advantage of efficient cloud web-hosting services.</p>

    <p>Successful midwifery, in the end: the MGNREGA Public Data Portal was born in March 2014. For the first time, anyone who wanted to know how MGNREGA was working could log onto a website and, with a few clicks, ask the questions of the data to which they needed answers. Later that year, DFID funding allowed the team (Dodge, Moore, and Ravi Suhag, a Delhi-based tech consultant who had newly come onboard) to conduct a pilot project to extend the software. It would make the Portal more suited to the needs of lower-level administrators through a companion set of interactive data visualizations, the Report Dashboards.</p>
   
    <p>These dashboards, in turn, would expand the capacity of these administrators to perform their jobs informed by detailed, accurate data – the administration of which would be delivered into Ministry hands. "One of the key things we wanted was, not to build a system outside the existing government system, but to have something fully integrated that can be maintained by the individuals there," Pande says. "So it was critical that we were able bring technical advice into the ministry: that’s what the BCURE funding allowed us to do."</p>
   
    <p>In August 2014, the EPoD team launched these new features to an audience of a few MoRD officials in a room and, via videoconference, state-level administrators from each of about twenty states. They gave a walkthrough of how to create reports, and received polite applause. </p>
   
    <p>Given that modest christening (and the fact that bureaucrats are often set in their ways) the researchers wondered if the Portal would see much use. But in the year following the launch, the Reports Dashboard alone received 150,000 views by over 100,000 users. Meanwhile, NIC technicians, convinced of the project’s worth, maintained and updated the portal, making it more robust and versatile.</p>

    <h2 id="next">Next step: test and refine</h2>

    <p>It appears that the collaboration has produced a useful product in terms of its features. Subrahmanyam describes how the Portal can benefit the <em>gram rozgar sevak</em>. "He can track his own performance on a timescale and also his relative performance vis-à-vis other geographical units – other villages – across a number of parameters: provision of work, number of days of employment provided, delays in payment, quantum of work done, type of work done. All of these things can be monitored with the dashboard. He can always see how the unit above him is doing and how the unit below him is doing – other villages, other blocks, the district average and the national average. And the people above him can watch his performance."</p>
    
    <p>But are the administrators at the <em>panchayat</em>, block, and district level using their new tools? All those website hits mean little if the policy actors are not using the information to improve MGNREGA.</p>
    
    <p>The next step in this policy-research engagement is to test whether visualized, easy-to-understand presentations of data can increase data usage by officials relative to plain-text versions of the same information. Working in the state of Bihar, one of India’s most capacity and resource-constrained areas, EPoD researchers are examining these questions.</p>
    
    <p>In the study, EPoD researchers send visualized report cards of MGNREGA performance data to officials on a randomized basis, showing performance in a variety of ways. They are attempting to determine the best ways of getting low-level bureaucrats interested in looking at the data. What days and times are notifications most likely to be opened? What packaging is most effective – negative information (<em>There are major payment delays in your district</em>)? Positive information (<em>See how you’ve progressed toward your goal of cutting delays</em>)? Or peer comparisons (<em>Look at how the neighbouring districts are doing</em>)? </p>
    
    <p>Moore says, "We’re seeing intriguing results as far as visualized information. Officers are more likely to open that email and look at their ranking. So there’s a higher appetite to take in that data."</p>
    
    <p>In another experiment, EPoD is working with officials in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Jharkhand to test how presenting data on delays can help speed up the payment process. The researchers are developing tools – a web-based payment delays dashboard and a mobile app – that track the sub-steps in the payment process, pinpoint the bottlenecks in the system, and deliver that information to higher-tier administrators.</p>
    
    <p>Additionally, data from the Portal is spawning and enabling other academic research. Working in four rural districts in Madhya Pradesh state, EPoD researchers are giving bank accounts to women as destinations for their MGNREGA payments, which otherwise often go into the account of the head-of-household, usually the husband or father. The researchers are testing the effects of owning an account on certain measures of female empowerment, such as household bargaining power and labour force participation.</p>
    
    <p>"We often have questions," Pande says, "such as where to target our intervention and how the payment flows of MGNREGA are occurring, which are required for us to expect any activity in the bank. So we’re constantly going to the portal to monitor MGNREGA activity."</p> 

    <p>Finally, officials at the Ministry of Rural Development are using the Portal for their own purposes, finding new uses for data they had already been collecting. Reddy Subrahmanyam says, "From the data points we’re trying to identify workers who have depended on this wage employment for a long period, and try and see whether we can upgrade them from an unskilled category to a skilled category. Once they become a skilled worker, then they don’t need to depend on the government. The market takes care of them."</p>   

    <h2 id="transparency">Transparency: should citizens or government take the lead?</h2>
    
    <p>When asked why he and his team put so much effort into making MGNREGA’s data open and accessible, Santhosh Mathew seems surprised by the question. "It’s a requirement of the Act!" he says.</p>
    
    <p>India’s Right to Information Act, or RTI, requires government to provide citizens information on request, and government agencies to proactively disclose information on their implementation. It is a strong piece of legislation, at least on paper. A <a href="http://www.law-democracy.org/live/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Report-1.13.09.Overview-of-RTI-Rating.pdf" target="_blank">2013 ranking</a> of the quality of freedom of information legislation across countries (based on scope, procedures, promotional measures, etc.) gave the RTI 130 out of 150 possible points. In a ranking of 95 countries, India tied with Slovenia in second place, just behind Serbia.</p>
    
    <p>But another index that considers a number of real-world indicators, the <a href="http://barometer.opendataresearch.org/report/analysis/rankings.html" target="_blank">Open Data Barometer</a>, puts India halfway down the list at number 39 of 83 countries ranked. Here, India’s position is dragged down by the low impact the RTI and other open data initiatives have had in political, economic, and social terms. This is despite the huge popularity of the RTI: at <a href="http://www.freedominfo.org/2015/07/indians-file-4-5-rti-requests-annually-study-estimates/" target="_blank">4.5 to 5 million information requests</a> filed per year, it is easily the most-used freedom of information law in the world.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>A strong law, widely used, but with low impact. Why the big implementation gap? "The MGNREGA website technically filled the requirement, but practically it didn’t," Mathew concedes, which was why the collaboration with EPoD was needed if MoRD was to fulfil both the letter and the spirit of the law.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="col-lg-8">
    <p>It may be that across the Indian government, ministries are fulfilling the letter of the Act, but not in a way that can create change. This is a challenge even for countries at the top of the Open Data Barometer ranking. The UK, for instance, made raw data on city council spending available online, but the site attracted a mere 200 hits per month. As Ben Worthy of Birkbeck College said in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2015/jun/10/council-finance-open-data-unread-by-voters" target="_blank">a piece</a> reporting the disappointing numbers, "Data needs a narrative, and PDF documents and spreadsheets don’t yet tell a good enough story."</p>
    
    <p>Indeed, information in PDF form may serve the needs of an individual with a grievance or a journalist with an article to write. But it hardly enables research on, say, the health impacts of a given policy, or the efficacy of large government programs. To track such big trends, you need digital data in a useable format.</p>
    
    <p>Furthermore, placing the onus of transparency on individual citizens puts them at risk. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/09/10/india-new-killing-right-information-activist" target="_blank">Human Rights Watch</a>, a US-based watchdog, has estimated that in India 45 RTI users and activists have been killed since 2005, and over 250 assaulted, harassed, or threatened as a result of their requests. And far more often, RTI requests are killed through delays. There are currently <a href="http://www.livemint.com/Politics/pbwWRK4LnFwLcKF3dcLWRO/The-cost-of-delay-in-appointing-information-commissioners.html" target="_blank">millions of backlogged requests</a>, in part due to the slow appointments of commissioners to deal with them. Many interpret this as an expression of resistance from some corners of government.</p>
    
    <p>The good news is that online portals can make data tell its stories automatically. And they are possible in countries with limited resources. The MGNREGA project required catalysts – EPoD researchers, and funding from the BCURE programme – however, the ministry has risen to the challenge. Based on the knowledge co-created during the collaboration, ministry technicians now run the portal, and have been keeping it current as data continues to pour in.</p>
    
    <p>As the technology becomes cheaper and better, more governments will be able to actively publish administrative data in a useable format. This type of transparency circumvents both delays and the threat of reprisals by those who stand to lose. </p>

              <p>If governments heed the growing call for a "data revolution" and open their administrative data, citizens will likely see less corruption and better public service delivery. Researchers will undeniably reap big benefits, as they access exponentially more data with which to test their hypotheses. But even as governments comply and the data becomes available, we have begun to see the cracks in big data and the need to come up with scientific and organizational fixes in order to make the data revolution really increase transparency.</p>

              <p>You don’t get much bigger or more open data on development than that produced by MGNREGA, yet it took a technically and politically complex process to make it transparent.</p>

              <p>A number of recent articles have exposed the gaps between big datasets and their usability, reliability and utility. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/04/28/using-opinion-surveys-to-monitor-the-u-n-s-sustainable-development-goals/" target="_blank">Pippa Norris</a> has written on the need to "triangulate" big data with more focused measures to track development; <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jun/22/why-we-shouldnt-get-too-excited-about-using-big-data-for-development" target="_blank">Paul Jasper</a> on the security risks involved, and remembering the still-huge undigitized population; <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jul/13/big-small-data-global-development" target="_blank">Daniella Ballou-Aares and Tony Pipa</a> on the financial investment required; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/07/20/data-poverty-makes-it-harder-to-fix-real-poverty-thats-why-the-un-should-push-countries-to-gather-and-share-data/" target="_blank">Rohini Pande and Florian Blum</a> on the political economy considerations involved; and <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/big-data-actually-reinforcing-social-inequalities/" target="_blank">Michelle Chen</a> on ways that big data can reinforce social inequalities – to name just a few.</p>

    <p>It is an essential part of democracy to debate whether large programs are worth the money. Transparency will help defend effective programs and expose leaky or underperforming ones. The culture of openness surrounding MGNREGA has allowed the debate about its effectiveness to be informed by data, unlike many other more opaque areas of governments across the world. Yet, as we’ve seen, achieving transparency is more than a matter of casting back a curtain and revealing the truth – it’s a complex process of actively producing data and making it useable. </p>
    
    <p>Calls for transparency are not enough. Freedom of information laws should go beyond simply giving citizens the right to make requests, and beyond requiring ministries to release their data – they should require an add-on to make sure the data is useable. The more researchers work with governments to determine what such an add-on entails, the more durable and scalable it will be, and the more open data will lead to open societies.</p>

              <p>A <a href="http://www.transparency-initiative.org/reports/open-data-study-new-technologies" target="_blank">2010 report</a> by the Transparency and Accountability Initiative argued that in countries where data was open and useable for change, three tiers of society had been engaged:</p>

              <blockquote>An influential and active civil society provided the ‘bottom up’ pressure for change through traditional advocacy and by setting up innovative websites demonstrating how open information could be used. Civil servants and state and federal administrators who saw open data as a way of improving efficiency provided the ‘middle layer’. Finally, high-level political leaders including Heads of States and Ministers provided the third layer.</blockquote>

              <p>In India, the millions of RTI requests that have been filed in the last decade serve as strong evidence of “bottom up” pressure for transparency in Indian society. In their BCURE training activities and other collaborations with government ministries, EPoD researcher have seen among the “middle layer” a broad recognition of the value of open data, or at least a willingness to learn.</p>

              <p>It remains up to that top layer to invest in data infrastructure needed for government to be actively transparent. This is not cheap. But like physical infrastructure – roads, power grids, water systems – improvements may pay for themselves through efficiency gains in the long run, and will confer benefits on the population in the meantime.</p>
